# Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning
# POGIL Role (pronounced poh-gul)

# Team Learning - optimized

Research has shown that students who work together learn more, understand more, remember more, and acquire essential collaboration skills.

At times we will use team based activities to learn new topics.

The teams will be 3 to 4 students, and each student will have a distinct role:
- Manager
- Spokesperson
- Recorder
- Strategy analyst

Roles will rotate each week
