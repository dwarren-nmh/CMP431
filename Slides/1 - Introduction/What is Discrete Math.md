# Discrete Math and Python

## Introduction

# What is Discrete Math?

It's **discrete**, not discreet

- Discrete: constituting a separate entity : individually distinct 
  eg. *This pie can be cut into several discrete sections*

- Discreet: unobtrusive, unnoticeable
  eg. *I followed the car at a discreet distance*

# What is Discrete Math?

In algebra and calculus, everything is **continuous**.

Have you ever "zoomed" in really far in desmos?

## Example:

$f(x) = x^2$ has the range $[0,\infty]$ since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers $0$ and greater. This is **NOT** discrete. The Real number set does not contain individual, separate, entities.

In fact, on the real number set, there are infinite numbers between 1 and 2, just as there are infinite numbers between 1.1 and 1.2

# What is Discrete Math?

In discrete math, every number is **separate**.

## Example:

The function that gives the number of siblings you all have.
The set that represents how many siblings each student in this class has looks something like this: $\{0,1,2,3,...\}$. Maybe $4$ is in there too, and $5$, but I don't think anyone in here has $3.14159$ siblings. That's not possible.

The output here **is discrete** because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each of you is separate from one another (assuming there are no siblings in this class).

## What problems can we solve with it?

1. You show up for a very important meeting with 9 other people. It's decided that to start, everyone should shake hands. Assuming all 10 people each shake hands with every other person (but not themselves) exactly once, how many handshakes take place in total?

2. At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five. This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant. How many hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat? How many hot dogs were eaten all together?

3. After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber. The room is empty except for two large chests. On each is carved a message (strangely in English).

   **Chest #1 says:** If this chest is empty, then the other chest's message is true
   **Chest #2 says:** This chest is filled with treasure OR the other chest contains deadly scorpions

You know exactly one of these messages is true. What should you do?

4. Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?

# What is Discrete Math?

## It's hard to define

Discrete Math is a broad field that includes a lot of different subjects.

In this course we will learn:

- Counting, Probabilities, Vectors and Matrices, Parity, invariants, finite strategy games, Number Systems, Algorithms, Sets and Functions

Through it all we will rely on python, a programming language, as our tool to solve problems.
